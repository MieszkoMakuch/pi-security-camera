# Raspberry Pi Smart Security Camera
Security camera running open-cv for object detection. The camera will send an email with an image of any objects it detects. It also runs a server that provides a live video stream over the internet.

## Setup

This project uses a USB Camera to stream video. Before running the code, make sure you have connected at least one USB Camera to your device.


## Installing Dependencies

This project uses openCV to detect objects in the video feed. You can install openCV by using the following [tutorial](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/04/18/install-guide-raspberry-pi-3-raspbian-jessie-opencv-3/). In this project Python 2.7 version was used.

The installation took about 1-2 hours on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, but it would be considerably slower on a less powerful board like the Raspberry Pi Zero (it may eaven take about 8 hours).

The tutorial will prompt you to create a virtual environment. Make sure you are using the virtual environment by typing the following commands

```bash
source ~/.profile
workon cv
```

Next, navigate to the repository directory

```
cd Smart-Security-Camera
```

and install the dependencies for the project

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If you're running python3, you'll have to change the import statements at the top of the mail.py file*

```
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.image import MIMEImage
```
*and change your print statements from quotes to parenthesis*

```
print "" => print()
```

## Customization

To get emails when objects are detected, you'll need to make a couple modifications to the `mail.py` file.

Open `mail.py` with vim `vim mail.py`, then press `i` to edit. Scroll down to the following section

```
# Email you want to send the update from (only works with gmail)
fromEmail = 'myemail@gmail.com'
fromEmailPassword = 'password1234'

# Email you want to send the update to
toEmail = 'anotheremail@gmail.com'
```
and replace with your own email/credentials. The `mail.py` file logs into a gmail SMTP server and sends an email with an image of the object detected by the security camera. 

Press `esc` then `ZZ` to save and exit.

You can also modify the `main.py` file to change some other properties.

```
email_update_interval = 600 # sends an email only once in this time interval
video_camera = VideoCamera(flip=True) # creates a camera object, flip vertically
object_classifier = cv2.CascadeClassifier("models/fullbody_recognition_model.xml") # an opencv classifier
```
Notably, you can use a different object detector by changing the path `"models/fullbody_recognition_model.xml"` in `object_classifier = cv2.CascadeClassifier("models/fullbody_recognition_model.xml")`.

to a new model in the models directory.

```
facial_recognition_model.xml
fullbody_recognition_model.xml
upperbody_recognition_model.xml
```

## Running the Program

Run the program

```
python main.py
```

You can view a live stream by visiting the ip address of your pi in a browser on the same network. You can find the ip address of your Raspberry Pi by typing `ifconfig` in the terminal and looking for the `inet` address. 

Visit `<raspberrypi_ip>:5000` in your browser to view the stream.

Note: To view the live stream on a different network than your Raspberry Pi, you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose a local tunnel. Once downloaded, run ngrok with `./ngrok http 5000` and visit one of the generated links in your browser.

Note: The video stream will not start automatically on startup. To start the video stream automatically, you will need to run the program  from your `/etc/rc.local` file see this [video](https://youtu.be/51dg2MsYHns?t=7m4s) for more information about how to configure that.
